Results
Compared year over year, 2017 has achieved great postive returns on all stocks except TERP, which ended with negative return. On the contrary, 2018 overall performance on the return was negative for majority, except two ENPH and RUN.Those two stocks are the only two that achieved positive returns on two consecutive years. 

 Summary
The advantages of refactoring code in general is that it could help to generate a overall return and performance report for 10 stocks over 2 years.  The disadvantage is that it does not provide other statistic analysis for the dollar amount value and only calculate the percentage return.
